# Cash-Register
 
This is a developing project to simulate a cash register.

Disclaimer: Do not use this program in lieu of an actual cash register. This is more of a simulation of a cash register that I am making as to practice my python programming.

Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/ZsWcSYZW

My plans:

	Version 1.0: Essentially a very basic console-based calculator.
		
		Version 1.1: Add button controls instead of having to input text into the console.

	Version 2: Allow to export data to a spreadsheet
	
	Version 3: GUI, maybe?
